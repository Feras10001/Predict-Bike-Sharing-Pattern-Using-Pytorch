# Title: Predicting Bike-Sharing Data using Neural Network

Project motivation: In this project, I'll built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! The data is for bike daily renatl, and here I am trying to predict daily bike rental ridership by building linear regression neural netwrok using Pytorch

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: The following libraries are included:

Pandas
numpy
pytorch
seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files in the repository:

[Preditction]: contains the code 
[hour]: bike rentel data
[my answer]: The neural network model
data used: it was obtained from Udacity

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Results: You can find a summary of my result either at the presentation, report, or by going through my Jupytor Notebook.
